## Overview
Armoire is a virtual wardrobe application designed to help users manage their clothing items. It assists users in decluttering, identifying gaps in wardrobes,
and seeing what clothes they already own to keep in mind for future purchases. 


## Armoire Features
- Add new wardrobe items with details including their image, category, title, description, size, condition, price, colour, brand and material. 
- Allows users to delete wardrobe items.
- Allows users to filter through wardrobe items by category, size, condition, price and colour.
- Allows users to search through the wardrobe items.
- Displays the user's wardrobe items in a scrollable list.
- Users can click on items in the RecyclerView layout to view their details and delete them if they wish to.

## Notes
Further developments will include the implementation of outfit planning and a fix to the shoe sizing bug.
The app may run a little slowly on emulators, so if a button doesn't seem to work, that isn't the case.

## Requirements / advice
You'll need to add the google-services.json file to your app folder. 
The app is called Armoire, so if you can't find it on your emulator, search for Armoire. 
If running it from the zipped file, unzip the file , and import it
